# SortingVisualization
"I created a Sorting Visualization project in Java to demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The project visually represents the step-by-step process of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, helping users understand how data is sorted in real time."
